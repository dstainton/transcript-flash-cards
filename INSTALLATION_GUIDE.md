# Transcript Flashcards - Windows Installation Guide

## What You Need
- **Python 3.7+** installed from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure "Add Python to PATH" is checked during installation
- **OpenAI API Key** from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/)

## ‚úÖ Upgrading from a Previous Version?

**Good news!** Your existing data is 100% safe:
- ‚úÖ Your API key (`openaikey.txt`) will never be overwritten
- ‚úÖ Your session security key (`secret_key.txt`) is preserved
- ‚úÖ Existing flashcards, history, and transcripts are automatically migrated
- ‚úÖ Original files are backed up with `.backup` extension
- ‚úÖ Migration happens automatically on first run - no action needed!

## First-Time Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Add Your OpenAI API Key
1. Open the application folder
2. Create a new text file named `openaikey.txt`
3. Paste your OpenAI API key into this file
4. Save and close

### Step 2: Start the Application
**Option A - Quick Start:**
- Simply double-click `start_flashcards.bat`
- Wait while it sets up (only happens once)
- Your browser will open automatically

**Option B - Desktop Shortcut:**
1. Double-click `CREATE_SHORTCUT.vbs`
2. Click "OK" when the confirmation appears
3. A shortcut named "Scrum Flashcards" appears on your desktop
4. Use this shortcut to start the app anytime

### Step 3: You're Done!
The application is now running at http://localhost:5000

## What Happens on First Run

The `start_flashcards.bat` script automatically:
1. ‚úÖ Creates an isolated Python environment (`.venv` folder)
2. ‚úÖ Installs all required packages (Flask, OpenAI, flask-session, PDF/Word processors)
3. ‚úÖ **Migrates existing data** to new project structure (if you're upgrading)
   - Creates a default project with your existing flashcards
   - Preserves all your history and mastery progress
   - Backs up original files for safety
4. ‚úÖ Starts the web server
5. ‚úÖ Opens your browser

**This setup only happens once!** Future runs start immediately.

### New Features Available After Migration
- üìÅ **Multi-Project Support** - Create separate projects for different topics
- ü§ñ **AI Project Creation** - Drag & drop documents to auto-generate flashcards
- üìä **Per-Project Statistics** - Each project tracks its own progress
- üéØ **Enhanced Mastery System** - Better tracking of learned cards

## Daily Use

### Starting the Application
- Double-click `start_flashcards.bat`, OR
- Use the desktop shortcut (if created), OR
- Navigate to the folder and run the batch file

### Stopping the Application
- Press `Ctrl+C` in the command window, OR
- Close the command window, OR  
- Double-click `stop_flashcards.bat`

## Understanding the Files

### Files You Interact With
- `start_flashcards.bat` - Start the application
- `stop_flashcards.bat` - Stop the application
- `CREATE_SHORTCUT.vbs` - Create desktop shortcut
- `openaikey.txt` - Your API key (you create this - **never overwritten**)

### Files Created Automatically (Never Overwritten)
- `.venv/` - Isolated Python environment (safe to delete to reset)
- `.flask_session/` - Session storage (temporary)
- `temp_uploads/` - Temporary document uploads
- `secret_key.txt` - Security key for sessions (**preserved**)
- `projects/` - Multi-project data folder
  - `<project-id>/` - Each project has its own folder
    - `project.json` - Project metadata
    - `flashcards.json` - Project's flashcards
    - `history.json` - Project's session history
    - `mastery.json` - Project's mastery tracking
    - `documents/` - Original source documents

### Legacy Files (Auto-Migrated on First Run)
If upgrading from an older version:
- `flashcards.json` ‚Üí Moved to `projects/<default-project>/`
- `history.json` ‚Üí Moved to `projects/<default-project>/`
- `mastery.json` ‚Üí Moved to `projects/<default-project>/`
- `transcripts/` ‚Üí Moved to `projects/<default-project>/documents/`
- **Originals backed up** with `.backup` extension

### Application Files (Don't Modify)
- `app.py` - Main application code
- `project_manager.py` - Project management logic
- `document_processor.py` - Document text extraction
- `migrate_to_projects.py` - Auto-migration script
- `requirements.txt` - List of dependencies
- `static/` - CSS styling
- `templates/` - HTML pages

## Troubleshooting

### "Python is not installed or not in PATH"
- Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
- During installation, check "Add Python to PATH"
- Restart your computer

### "openaikey.txt not found"
- Create the file `openaikey.txt` in the same folder as `start_flashcards.bat`
- Paste your API key into this file
- Make sure it's named exactly `openaikey.txt` (not `.txt.txt`)

### Server won't start
- Make sure no other Flask app is running on port 5000
- Try running `stop_flashcards.bat` first
- Delete the `.venv` folder and run again (forces reinstall)

### Browser doesn't open automatically
- Manually open your browser
- Go to http://localhost:5000

### Starting fresh
1. Run `stop_flashcards.bat`
2. Delete `.venv` folder
3. Optionally delete `projects/` folder to remove all project data
4. Keep `openaikey.txt` and `secret_key.txt`
5. Run `start_flashcards.bat` again

### After migrating, where is my data?
- Your existing flashcards are in `projects/<default-project-name>/flashcards.json`
- Your history is in `projects/<default-project-name>/history.json`
- Your mastery data is in `projects/<default-project-name>/mastery.json`
- Your original transcripts are in `projects/<default-project-name>/documents/`
- Original root-level files are backed up with `.backup` extension

## Advanced: Virtual Environment Benefits

The `.venv` folder is a **virtual environment** that:
- ‚úÖ Keeps this app's packages separate from your system Python
- ‚úÖ Prevents conflicts with other Python projects
- ‚úÖ Makes the app portable and reproducible
- ‚úÖ Can be safely deleted if you need to start fresh

**You never need to manually activate it** - the batch file does this automatically!

## Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the command window for error messages
2. Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed and in PATH
3. Verify `openaikey.txt` exists and contains your API key
4. Try deleting `.venv` and running again
5. Check the README.md for more detailed information
