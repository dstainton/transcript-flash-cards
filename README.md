## Quick Start (Windows)

### Easy Method - Double-Click to Start

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Install Python 3.7 or higher from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)

3. **Run:**
   - Double-click `start_flashcards.bat`
   - The script will:
     - Create an isolated virtual environment (`.venv`) 
     - Install all required dependencies (including document processing libraries)
     - Automatically migrate existing data to the new project structure (if needed)
     - Start the Flask server
     - Automatically open your browser to http://localhost:5000

4. **Stop:**
   - Press `Ctrl+C` in the command window, or
   - Double-click `stop_flashcards.bat`

### Manual Installation (All Platforms)

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dstainton/transcript-flash-cards.git
   cd transcript-flash-cards
   ```

2. **Create Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv

  - Total exam time in seconds (`TOTAL_EXAM_TIME`)

## Running the Application

**Windows (Easy Method):**
- Double-click `start_flashcards.bat`

**Manual Method:**
```bash
# Activate virtual environment first (if using)
python app.py

### Legacy Files (Auto-Migrated)
If you have data from an older version, these files will be automatically migrated:
- `flashcards.json` → Moved to `projects/<default-project>/flashcards.json`
- `history.json` → Moved to `projects/<default-project>/history.json`
- `mastery.json` → Moved to `projects/<default-project>/mastery.json`
- `transcripts/` → Moved to `projects/<default-project>/documents/`

**Original files are backed up** with a `.backup` extension for safety.

## Data Persistence

- **Project Data:** Each project stores its own data in `projects/<project-id>/`
  - `flashcards.json` - Generated flashcards for the project
  - `history.json` - Study and exam session history
  - `mastery.json` - Mastery tracking per flashcard
  - `documents/` - Original source documents
  - `project.json` - Project metadata (name, ID, creation date)
- **Sessions:** Managed via server-side Flask sessions in `.flask_session/`
- **API Key:** Stored in `openaikey.txt` (never overwritten, must be created by user)
- **Secret Key:** Stored in `secret_key.txt` (auto-generated, preserved across updates)

**Important:** Your existing data is safe! The first time you run the updated version, any existing flashcards, history, and transcripts will be automatically migrated to a default project.
