# Phase 1: Core Refactoring - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview
Successfully refactored the entire application from a single-project architecture to a multi-project system. All existing functionality is preserved while adding the foundation for multiple projects.

## Commits Made

### 1. Project Management Infrastructure
**Commit**: `[Phase 1] Add Project and ProjectManager classes`
- Created `Project` class to encapsulate project data
- Created `ProjectManager` class to manage multiple projects
- Each project has isolated flashcards, mastery, and history
- Folder structure: `projects/{project-id}/`

### 2. Migration System
**Commit**: `[Phase 1] Add migration script for existing data`
- Created automatic migration from old structure to new
- Safely moves all existing data to default project
- Creates backups of original files
- Can be run multiple times safely

### 3. Complete App Refactoring
**Commit**: `[Phase 1] Refactor app.py to use project-based architecture`
- Integrated ProjectManager into main app
- Auto-runs migration on startup
- All routes now project-aware
- Helper functions use current project
- Backward compatible - existing users won't notice
