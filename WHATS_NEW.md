# What's New - Recent Updates

## 🎉 Latest Features (November 2024)

### 1. ✨ Enhanced Project Creation with Full Control

**Your Feedback:** "When I drag 32 lesson files, I want one topic per file, not 6 random topics"

**What We Fixed:**
- ✅ **Two Topic Strategies:**
  - **One Topic Per File** (Recommended) - Each file = one topic
  - **AI-Extracted Topics** - AI finds 3-8 themes across all content
  
- ✅ **Full Customization:**
  - Edit topic names before generation
  - Set flashcard count per topic (5-50 cards)
  - See real-time totals
  
- ✅ **Better Project Names:**
  - AI considers ALL uploaded files
  - Detects course/certification titles
  - Fully editable

**Example:**
```
Before: Upload 32 lessons → Get 6 random AI-extracted topics
Now:    Upload 32 lessons → Get 32 topics (one per file) with customizable names and card counts

Topic Names: "Lesson 01 Roles in a Scrum Project" (exactly as you named it, minus extension)
```

### 2. 💡 Answer Explanations

**Your Feedback:** "I want to know WHY my answer was wrong, not just see 'A' or 'True'"

**What We Added:**
- ✅ Every flashcard includes AI-generated explanations
- ✅ Explanations show for BOTH correct and incorrect answers
- ✅ 1-2 sentences explaining the concept
- ✅ Helps reinforce learning even when guessing correctly

**Example:**
```
Question: "The Product Owner must be a technical expert."
Your Answer: False ✅
Explanation: The Product Owner is primarily a business-oriented role, 
focusing on maximizing product value rather than technical expertise.
```

### 3. 💾 Auto-Save Session Progress

**Your Feedback:** "I did 10 cards, went to Stats, and nothing showed up"

**What We Fixed:**
- ✅ Sessions now auto-save when you navigate away
- ✅ Works when clicking: Home, Stats, Mastery, Projects
- ✅ Shows notification: "Session progress saved: X/Y (Z%)"
- ✅ Never lose progress again!
